# Country_network
Implement the heterogeneous topology with the protocols and the Access list TCP, ICMP etc
In the project, we have the countries like China India America and Israel Musaad
as we all know that in China we cant open the google and Facebook so if America wants to send packet they cant to send the packet will drop America  can't open the china web server
but India can send the packet to both the countries because we can execute everything 
Isreal has Musaad their secret agency it is that much private no one can send the packet to anyone but we can ping their router 
and have many more like (vtp) virtual trunking4 protocol
